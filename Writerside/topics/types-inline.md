# Inline Types

In TypeScript, an inline type refers to a type definition declared directly at the point of use without assigning it a separate name.

The names of GraphQL object types corresponding to TypeScript inline types are generated by excluding any non-alphanumeric characters.

For comparison, see <a href="types-referenced.md">referenced types</a> if you want to use a custom name.

## Example

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
}

@graphql.resolver()
class UserResolver {
  @graphql.query()
  getUserId(): Pick<User, 'id'> {
    // ...
  }
}
```
In this example, the return type `Pick<User, 'id'>` of the `getUserId` query resolver is not a valid object type name. 
<br />
To resolve this, non-alphanumeric characters are excluded, resulting in the generated name `PickUserid`.
```
type PickUserid {
  id: String!
}

type Query {
  getUserId: PickUserid
}
```
This ensures that the generated name is compatible with the GraphQL naming requirements.
