# Types

There is no code distinction between [Object Types](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/object-types/) and [Input Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types)

[Annotations](https://deepkit.io/documentation/runtime-types/types) and [Validation](https://deepkit.io/documentation/runtime-types/validation) are supported.

## UUID

## Array
An array is represented in GraphQL as a `List`.

## Date
The `Date` type is serialized as an ISO 8601 formatted string, and represented in GraphQL as a `DateTime` scalar.
